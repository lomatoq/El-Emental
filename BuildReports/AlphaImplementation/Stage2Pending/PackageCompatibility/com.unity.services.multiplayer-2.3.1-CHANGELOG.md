# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.1] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- Clients joining a Distributed Authority session now wait up to 315 seconds (previously 120) for the host to publish the session's join code before the join fails.

### Fixed

- Renaming a Matchmaker Environment Config (`.mme`) or Queue Config (`.mmq`) asset in the Project window no longer duplicates it in the Deployment window or throws an `ArgumentException`.
- Fixed Matchmaker config assets (`.mme` / `.mmq`) opening in the OS default application instead of the configured external script editor.
- Restarting a Distributed Authority network after `StopNetworkAsync` no longer throws `SessionError.AllocationAlreadyExists`.
- Fixed a `CS0619` compilation error on Unity 6000.4+ caused by an obsolete `int`-to-`EntityId` implicit cast in the Matchmaker config asset open handler.
- Fixed a potential `NullReferenceException` that could occur when exiting play mode when using sessions with Netcode for GameObjects.
- Fixed clients intermittently failing to connect to a Distributed Authority session when the host took more than a few seconds to publish the session's join code. The join now keeps waiting for the full timeout instead of giving up after roughly ten seconds.
- Joining a Distributed Authority session no longer fails with a `NullReferenceException` or a JSON parsing error when the session metadata on the lobby is temporarily missing, empty, or malformed. These states are now treated as "the join code has not been published yet" and the join keeps waiting, failing with a `SessionException` if the timeout is reached.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- `SessionConnector` now supports a Join operation in addition to Create and CreateOrJoin.
- `SessionConnector.WithSessionOptions` to configure session name, max players, privacy, lock state, and password.
- `SessionConnector.WithDirectNetworkOptions` to configure a direct IP/port network.
- `SessionConnector.WithRelayNetworkOptions(RelayConnectionOptions)` to configure a relay network (region, protocol, preserve-region in one object).
- `SessionConnector.WithJoinByCode` to join a session by join code, with an optional password.
- `SessionConnector.WithJoinById` to join a session by session ID, with an optional password.
- `SessionConnector.WithCreateOrJoin` to create or join a session by ID.
- `SessionConnector.GetSessionOptions` to read back the currently configured session creation settings.
- `SessionConnector.GetJoinOptions` to read back the currently configured join settings, returned as a `JoinOptions` value.
- `SessionConnector.GetRelayNetworkOptions` to read back the currently configured relay network settings.
- `SessionConnector.GetDirectNetworkOptions` to read back the currently configured direct IP/port network settings.
- `JoinOptions` struct exposing the join mode (`Mode`), `SessionId` (when joining by ID), `SessionCode` (when joining by code), and optional `Password`.
- `JoinSessionMode` is now public, allowing external code to inspect whether a connector is configured to join by code or by session ID.
- `RelayConnectionOptions` class combining relay region, transport protocol, and preserve-region into a single object accepted by `WithRelayNetworkOptions` and returned by `GetRelayNetworkOptions`.
- `DirectConnectionOptions` class returned by `GetDirectNetworkOptions`, exposing listen IP, publish IP, and port as a snapshot.

### Fixed

- Creating a Session Connector asset from the **Assets > Create > Services > Multiplayer > Session Connector** menu now enters inline rename mode in the Project window, consistent with other asset creation menus.
- The Distributed Authority and Relay network handlers no longer emit a redundant `LogError` before throwing a `SessionException`. The failure is surfaced only through the thrown exception, with the underlying exception preserved as `InnerException`. Recoverable failures that the caller handles no longer produce an uncatchable console error (which, for example, caused passing scenarios to fail under the Unity Test Runner).

## [2.2.4] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- Fixed session properties not reflecting the server response after `SavePropertiesAsync()` until `RefreshAsync()` was called explicitly.
- `WrappedLobbyService.TryCatchRequest` no longer throws a `NullReferenceException` when `HttpException<ErrorStatus>.ActualError` is null (empty-body HTTP error). Falls back to lifting the HTTP status into the lobby enum range with `Unknown` as the last resort.
- Matchmaker Queue Config asset's Team Count Min/Max are now edited with a min/max slider paired with numeric fields, so Min can never exceed Max and values can't go negative; values above the maximum (150) are not accepted as new input but are preserved for backward compatibility when already present in a config, and flagged with a warning.
- Matchmaker Queue Config asset's Player Count Min/Max are now edited with a min/max slider paired with numeric fields, so Min can never exceed Max and values can't go negative; values above the maximum (150) are not accepted as new input but are preserved for backward compatibility when already present in a config, and flagged with a warning.
- Matchmaker Queue Config asset's relaxation fields no longer accept invalid values: "Replacement Value" and "At Seconds" are clamped to zero when negative, and "Replacement Value" is clamped to Max when set higher.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Dependency update: Bump `com.unity.services.wire` to version 1.4.4 to fix wire failing to connect on WebGL when using multiple UnityServices instances.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- `Logger` accepts `UnityEngine.Object` as context.

### Changed
- `SessionConnectorBehaviour` emits warning messages with context. It allows to easily identify which gameobject is responsible for the warning by clicking on the warning message in the editor's console. Once clicked, it will highlight the gameobject which issued the warning message.

### Fixed 
- Fixed an issue where the connection task could be cancelled prematurely when an internal timeout was reached during session creation; session creation now correctly relies on the timeouts defined by NetworkManager when used with Netcode for GameObjects.
- Ensure the `SessionConnectorBehaviour` is no longer throwing `NullReferenceException` when `SessionConnector`'s multiplayer session is `null`.
- Fixed `SessionConnectorBehaviour`'s clean-up so it no longer throws `NullReferenceException`.
- Fixed `SessionConnectorBehaviour`'s inspector.
- Fixed `AddingSessionStarted` and `SessionAdded` not firing.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Fixed compilation errors when making builds caused by including editor-only code in runtime-only code.
- Use the Netcode for GameObjects timeouts for connecting and synchronizing the NetworkManager during session creation.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Multiplayer Session ScriptableObject to hold an ISession and expose the session events to the inspector.
- Session Connector ScriptableObject to populate the Multiplayer Session ScriptableObject. Create, Join and CreateOrJoin connectors are available they include session settings as well as network settings.
- Session Connector Wrapper Monobehaviour to automatically execute the specified connector on sign in.
- New verbose settings in `Project Settings > Services > Multiplayer`.

### Changed
- `ISession` created or joined through the `MultiplayerService` in playmode in the editor are automatically left when exiting playmode.

### Fixed
- Dependency update: Bump `com.unity.services.deployment` to version 1.7.1 to pick up an editor compatibility fix (InstanceID deprecation).
- Fixed a bug in the sessions API where if using direct connections and Netcode for GameObjects 2.8 or later, an erroneous endpoint would be used for the connection data, leading to errors about an "invalid listen endpoint" followed by an endpoint with the port duplicated.
- Exiting playmode in the Editor when a Session is connected with Netcode for GameObjects' `NetworkManager` doesn't log warnings anymore.
- Fixed wrong Exception handling in the Matchmaker module and the `NetworkMetadata` handler when joinning a `ISession` already connected to a `NetworkManager`.
- Fixed an issue where matchmaker queue deployment could fail when the queue contains filtered pools.
- Fixed player data change event handling.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Introduced `SessionOptions` and `JoinSessionOptions.WithNetworkOptions(NetworkOptions options)` API to allow specific per-client session settings during session creation and joining.
- `NetworkOptions` setting includes a `RelayProtocol` field, enabling clients to specify their `RelayProtocol` when connecting to Relay or Distributed Authority.
  - Note: This setting takes precedence over any `RelayProtocol` value passed to a `WithRelayNetwork` or `WithDistributedAuthority` option.
- Added methods in `CreateBackfillTicketOptions` for setting assignment information for backfilling.
- Added `CreateSessionAsync` method in `IMultiplayerServerService` to create a session with a provided session ID for easy local iteration.
- Added `CreateMatchSessionAsync` method in `IMultiplayerServerService` to create a session from a matchmaker match ID.

### Changed
- The `RelayProtocol` value set in `SessionOptions.WithRelayNetwork` and `SessionOptions.WithDistributedAuthority` is obsolete, replaced by the new `.WithNetworkOptions` API.
- The `CreateAssetWithTextContent` method replaces the `CreateAssetWithContent` method starting from version `6000.4`.

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with Matchmaker configuration `mmq` file deployment, which failed when a relaxation rule didn't have a value, even if it was valid.

Defaults remain the same: Most platforms use DTLS as a default connection, and WebGL still defaults to WSS. Use the `RelayNetworkOptions` variant to override default behavior.
- Added a `WithDirectNetwork` overload that accepts `DirectNetworkOptions`, taking `ListenIpAddress` and `PublishIpAddress` parameters.
- Added a `WithDirectNetwork` overload that accepts no arguments, ensuring backward compatibility with the previous `WithDirectNetwork` overload.
- Added player name integration into multiplayer sessions:
  - `WithPlayerName()` session option for a player to provide their name in a multiplayer session.
  - `GetPlayerName()` extension method to the session `IReadOnlyPlayer` model to retrieve a player's name.

- Added an Inspector for Matchmaker queue files to allow editing the most common properties of the Matchmaker Queue configuration in the editor.
- Added `Network` property to provide control over the network managed by the Session.
  - `IHostSession` provides the `IHostSessionNetwork` interface, allowing control over the network connection for the session.
  - `ISession` provides the `IClientSessionNetwork` interface, allowing access to the network state and relevant events.
  - Enter and exit games within the same multiplayer session.
  - Wait for specific conditions before starting the network connection and gameplay:
    - Session reaching max players.
    - All players marking themselves as ready through player properties.
    - Etc.
- Added `Network` property on `ISession` (`IClientSessionNetwork`) & `IHostSession` (`IHostSessionNetwork`) to provide control over the network managed by the Session. This allows entering and exiting games within the same multiplayer session.

  - `MultiplaySessionManagerOptions`.
  - `MultiplaySessionManagerOptions.SessionOptions`.
  - `MultiplaySessionManagerOptions.MultiplayServerOptions`.
- Added a new `MatchmakerQueueAsset` class created when importing `.mmq` files, which can be referenced from runtime assets.

- Added an Inspector for `.gsh` files to allow editing the most common properties of the Multiplay configuration in the editor.
- Custom inspector for `.gsh` files.

### Changed
- Changed soft dependency to the Services Deployment API in the QuickStart from `com.unity.deployment.api@1.1.0` to `com.unity.deployment@1.4.1`.
- Attempting to use an unsupported connection protocol on WebGL will throw an `ArgumentException` instead of logging a warning message.
- Matchmaker queue and environment configuration files will display their status against the remote configuration in the cloud project from the Deployment Window.
- Changed `IMultiplaySessionManager.StartMultiplaySessionManagerAsync` to await the full allocation and session initialization flow and cover all potential errors.
- Removed exception thrown when trying to access the session property in `IMultiplaySessionManager.Session`, as full initialization is now guaranteed.
- Removed error logging for unknown Lobby patch paths over Wire to support future Distributed Authority state updates.

### Fixed
- Creating a new Matchmaker Queue from the QuickStart menu no longer logs a path warning issue.
- Fixed first-time Matchmaker queue file deployment that would leave the Matchmaker disabled if no Matchmaker Environment file was deployed along with the queue files.

- Resolved an issue where a rule without a reference could not be deployed.
- Fixed assets being loaded despite being of the incorrect type.
- Fixed stale data used when deploying `.gsh` files via the deployment window.
- Resolved an issue where the `Task` would resolve before the `NetworkManager` was fully connected and synchronized when using Netcode for GameObjects.
- Resolved an issue where the `Task` would resolve before the `NetworkManager` had finished shutting down when using Netcode for GameObjects.
- Resolved an issue where some settings on the `NetworkManager` would remain changed after leaving a Distributed Authority session.
- Fixed an issue where joining clients to a relay-hosted game (either with Relay or Distributed Authority) could not connect due to an invalid relay protocol for their platform. The RelayProtocol from the `_session_network` property is now ignored by joining and reconnecting players. Players will always use the `RelayProtocol.Default` value instead.

## [1.1.8] - 2025-09-09

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where a rule without a reference could not be deployed.

## [1.1.7] - 2025-08-19

### Changed
- The user-provided allocation callback is now guaranteed to be invoked regardless of whether the session is created successfully.
  - If session creation fails, the `OnAllocate` callback will still be invoked. This means you must check whether the Session is null before using it. The deallocation callback will be invoked once the server times out.
- The user-provided deallocation callback is now guaranteed to be invoked.

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where the server, upon failing to create a session, would be left in a broken state.
